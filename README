Setup
-----
1. fork from http://github.com/jgoodsen/radtrack-core
	* follow directions on forking: http://help.github.com/forking/

2. cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml
3. cp config/smtp_config_template.rb config/smtp_config.rb

Now Edit the two files you just copied above for your local database and smtp email server configuration	

4. sudo gem install will_paginate
5. sudo gem install rspec
6. sudo rake gems:install
7. rake db:create:all
8. rake db:migrate (This also creates an admin user by default. Login is as 'admin@radtrack.com' and 'monkey')
9. rake spec

Running tests
-----------------
TODO: Still need to run all the tests at once with a single rake task..

We don't have rspec tests for controllers or views - although they should probably be skinnier

We currently have rspec tests for our models.  Run this with rake spec

We've started to us ScrewUnit for java script unit tests.  Run these with rake spec:javascript

We have Cucumber/Watir tests.  

Cucumber/Watir Configuration
-------------------------------
We have a small suite of cucumber tests that are more like smoke tests than exhaustive acceptance tests.  
They now use Watir to run (they used to use Selenium, but we found Watir to be simpler and more reliable)

Follow the Cucumber/Watir installation instructions at http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber

Run cucumber tests, you need to do the following:

  2. run the rails server in a cucumber environment: script/server -e cucumber
  3. run "rake cucumber".  Use "rake cucumber:wip" to run @wip tagged cucumber features
