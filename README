Setup
-----
1. fork from http://github.com/jgoodsen/radtrack-core
	* follow directions on forking: http://help.github.com/forking/

2. cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml
3. cp config/smtp_config.rb.template config/smtp_config.rb

Now Edit the two files you just copied above for your local database and smtp email server configuration	

 sudo rake gems:install:all
 rake db:create:all
 rake db:migrate  # This also creates an admin user by default. 
 script/server # Login is as 'admin@radtrack.com' and 'monkey'


Running Micro Tests
-------------------

rake spec # make sure the system works
rake spec:javascript # if you want to see how poorly I'm testing my javascript :-)

I don't have rspec tests for controllers or views - although they should probably be skinnier


Running Acceptance Tests 
-------------------------
We have a small suite of cucumber tests that are more like smoke tests than exhaustive acceptance tests.  
They now use Watir to run (they used to use Selenium, but we found Watir to be simpler and more reliable)

Follow the Cucumber/Watir installation instructions at http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber

To run cucumber tests, you need to do the following:

  * run the rails server in one command window: script/server -e cucumber
  * run "rake cucumber:ok" in another command window.
