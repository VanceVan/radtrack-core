Running tests
-----------------
TODO: Still need to run all the tests at once with a single rake task..

We don't have rspec tests for controllers or views - although they should probably be skinnier

We currently have rspec tests for our models.  Run this with rake spec

We've started to us ScrewUnit for java script unit tests.  Run these with rake spec:javascript

We have Cucumber/Selenium tests.  

Cucumber/Selenium Configuration
-------------------------------
We have a small suite of cucumber tests that are more like smoke tests than exhaustive acceptance tests.  
They use Selenium to test drive the full application and simulate some basic user interactions like signing, creating/moving cards, etc.

Follow the Cucumber/Selenium installation instructions at http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/setting-up-selenium

Run cucumber tests, you need to do the following:

  1. run the command "selenium" in it's own window to start the selenium server.
  2. run the rails server in a cucumber environment: script/server -e cucumber
  3. run "rake cucumber".  Use "rake cucumber:wip" to run @wip tagged cucumber features
