Feature: WIP Limits

	As a Project Administrator, I want to impose WIP Limits on each swimlane in the project kanban
	In order to maintain maximum flow on a project.
	

@done
Scenario: A Blank WIP Limit means No Limit

@done
Scenario: A WIP Limit is by default specified as # of cards in a swimlane

Scenario: WIP Limit is optionally re-defined as a card point limit in a swimlane

@done
Scenario: Swimlane should be change border color when WIP is overlimit

Scenario: Project configuration to force a rejection dialog on WIP limit override

Scenario: Project configuration to warn and allow override on WIP limit dialog

Scenario: Swimlane properties dialog editor is available directly for each swimlane from the kanban board (when an administrator)

Scenario: Show outlined card placeholders in swimlanes with WIP limits
